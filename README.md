## Definitions - It's all pretty clear!
### OAuth
>An open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
### OIDC (OpenID Connect)
>An authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization framework. The standard is controlled by the OpenID Foundation.

## A slightly simplistic but 'good enough' way to think about it....
### Authorisation
>The act of giving permission - This is what **OAuth** does
### Authentication
>The act of verifying the identity of a user - This is what **OIDC** extends OAuth to do





## Understanding the history helps

**OpenID** is an open standard and decentralized **authentication** protocol promoted by the non-profit OpenID Foundation.
