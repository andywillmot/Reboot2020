## Definitions - It's all pretty clear!
OAuth - An open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
OIDC (OpenID Connect) - An authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization framework. The standard is controlled by the OpenID Foundation.

## A slightly simplistic but 'good enough' way to think about it....
Authorisation - The act of giving permission - This is what OAuth does
Authentication - The act of verifying the identity of a user - This is what OIDC extends OAuth to do

## Understanding the history helps

**OpenID** is an open standard and decentralized **authentication** protocol promoted by the non-profit OpenID Foundation.
